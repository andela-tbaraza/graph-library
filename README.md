## Introduction
A graph is a way of representing connections between places. Mathematically, a graph is a collection of nodes and edges. Nodes are locations that are connected together by the edges of the graph. For instance, if you had two small towns connected by a two-way road, you could represent this as a graph with two nodes, each node representing a town, and one edge, the road, connecting the two towns together.
A graph can be directed or undirected in which edges connect only one way. This library implements undirected graphs and allows you to create a .dot file that can be used to view the created graphs using [GraphViz](www.graphviz.org)

## Features
This library has the following methods:
